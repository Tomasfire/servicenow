<p>This App is an Ingestion source. In the Phantom documentation, in the <a href="../admin/">Administration Manual</a> under the <a href="../admin/sources">Data Sources</a> section, you will find an explanation of how Ingest Apps works and how information is extracted from the ingested data. There is a general explanation in Overview, and some individuals Apps have their sections.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>
   <ul>
		<li><b>Asset Configuration Parameter</b></li>
           <ul>
			   <li>
					on_poll_table: Table to ingest issues from.
			   </li>
			   <li>
					on_poll_filter: Filter to use with On Poll separated by '^' (e.g. description=This is a test^assigned_to=test.name).
			   </li>
			   <li>
					first_run_container: Max container (For first run of schedule polling).
			   </li>
			   <li>
					max_container: Max container (For other runs of schedule polling).

       <li><b>The functioning of On Poll</b></li>
			
			<ul>
				<li> The On Poll ingests the details of the tickets/records of a table provided by the user. A container will be created with a 'short_description' of ticket/record as its name. If ticket/record does not have any short_description, then, a default name will be given to the container.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>Two ways of polling</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li>Manual polling</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The application will fetch the number of tickets/records controlled by the container_count parameter in On Poll action.</li>
							<li>Tickets/records can be restricted by providing a filter in the configuration parameter</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<li>Scheduled Polling</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The application will fetch the number of tickets/records, controlled by the 'first_run_container' configuration parameter for the first run of the Scheduled Polling and by 'max_container' configuration parameter for the other runs of the  Scheduled Polling, whose start time or updated time is greater than or equal to the time mentioned in the 'last_time' variable in the state file.</li>
							<li>If the 'last_time' variable is not present in the state file i.e. the On Poll is executing for the first time, the application will fetch the number of tickets/records mentioned in the 'first_run_container' configuration parameter.</li>
							<li>The 'last_time' variable will be updated by the updated_time of the ticket/record which was last ingested.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
